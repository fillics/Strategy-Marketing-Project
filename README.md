# Strategy & Marketing - Project L'Orèal Brandstorm 2022
The aim of the project was to revolutionize beauty personalization & experience fueled by techs. My team and I have decided to create ArmOrèal: a platform that makes online shopping easier and faster and that ensures a personalized experience. It helps users to choose makeup and hair coloring following one of the most popular fashion trends: armocromia.
